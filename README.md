# FinancialTimeSeriesPlayground

Playground where research was undertaken to learn more about different time series classification, forecasting, and clustering models and methodologies. Not a full-scale repository, instead is simply rough work where research was put into notes, and research was applied on creating accurate models in an effort to learn more about the models. Next steps are to clean up and apply appropriate coding standards.
